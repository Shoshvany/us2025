Hello Noam,

Thanks for registering for an MIT campus visit. You're all set for your visit on at Thursday, October 2, 2025 at 2:00 PM. In the meantime, here are a few tips about planning your visit.

When to arrive
Please plan to be at the MIT Welcome Center (292 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142) 15 minutes early for check-in. Our staff will be there to welcome you starting 30 minutes before your programming begins.

Traveling to campus
Before heading to MIT, check out the Maps, directions, parking page on our website for more information on how to get here. Parking on campus is extremely limited, so we strongly recommend that you take the subway (called the "T" in Boston), bus, or a taxi/rideshare service. The MIT Welcome Center is located next to the Kendal/MIT stop.

Visit duration
If you signed up for an event titled "Information Session + Campus Tour" your visit will consist of a 30-minute information session, and a 1-hour campus tour.

If you signed up for an event titled "Campus Tour" your visit will consist of a 1-hour walking tour of campus.

If you signed up for an event titled "Information Session" your visit will consist of a 30-minute information session.

No luggage storage
We are unable to store luggage, backpacks, or other personal items during your visit. We thank you for planning in advance.

Need to reschedule or cancel?
We understand that things come up. Just visit the Edit Registration page to update your information or cancel your registration. If there's another visit that works better for you, we ask that you cancel your existing registration and sign up for the new date on our Visit page. 

Planning your day
We are sure you have many things you want to do while visiting the area, but here are a few of our favorites in case you have some spare time:

List Visual Arts Center. On campus. Free to all. The List is a contemporary art museum/creative laboratory that provides artists with a space to freely experiment and push boundaries.
MIT Museum. Across the walkway from the Welcome Center. The MIT Museum aims to "turn MIT inside out" by making our work more visible to the outside world. More than one million objects explore the wide interests of the MIT community from its founding in 1861 to today's cutting-edge research.
In case you just need to sit down for a minute. On campus. Roaming around all day can take a toll on you, so here are some of Eric P's '17, favorite places to sit (and study) on campus.
Want more? Check out our self-guided walking tour so you can plan out what you want to see when you get here!

Safe travels, and we're excited to see you soon!
